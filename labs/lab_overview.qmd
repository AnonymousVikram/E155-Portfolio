## Background

The Microprocessor Systems class at Harvey Mudd employs a lab-based approach to testing absorption of material. As a result of this, there are seven labs covering a wide variety of topics, each of which has clear guidelines and a report. Below, links can be found to the original task and the corresponding write-up for my submission.
