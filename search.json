    "text": "Coming into Mudd, I was dead set on pursuing robotics. I always enjoyed it in High School and thought that’s what I wanted to do for the rest of my life. I even set up my own major in Engineering and Computer Science to help facilitate this and enable me to take more relevant courses.\nHowever, all of this changed when I took E85 — Digital Electronics and Computer Architecture. Something about the logic paths and thinking about the microarchitecture really spoke to me. Since then, I have been selected as a Clay-Wolking fellow, and want to further pursue my newfound interest in this field.\nWith this in mind, I have a couple of primary goals that I want to achieve to think of my time in E155 as successful:\n\nBecome a lot more comfortable writing SystemVerilog, keeping in mind it’s meant for synthesis of hardware\nBuild my ability to plan out and reason through datapaths\nLearn new communication protocols and other specifics of microarchitecture\nCreate a cool final project!\n\nAs with all things, I believe that the best way to learn and improve my skills is by applying it, and I can’t wait to do that within this course!"
